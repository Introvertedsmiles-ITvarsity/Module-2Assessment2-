    <p>Synopsis:
"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)" follows Riggan Thomson, a washed-up actor famous for playing the iconic superhero Birdman. Desperate to revive his career and regain relevance, Riggan embarks on a risky endeavor by directing and starring in a Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story. As he navigates through the challenges of mounting a stage production, including conflicts with his volatile co-star, personal insecurities, and a strained relationship with his daughter, Riggan grapples with his own sanity. Blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, the film explores themes of ego, identity, and the quest for artistic validation in a world obsessed with celebrity culture.</p>
